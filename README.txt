CIS605 - Project Part 1 
User Interface

Notes to Grader

(Using README.txt file as it's easier and cleaner than the 
comment block in Canvas.)

I'm hoping this gets looked at as a work in progress, as
there are several things I'm not entirely happy with, but
at same time - I don't think they will come together until
much further down the road as the business logic gets added.

Biggest issue is / was I am not entirely happy at all
with the visual appearance of using parallel list boxes
to display tabular data.

You will find I am experimenting with other container 
types on several panels.  I'm not happy with that look
either, but it's closer to what I am shooting for than
the parallel boxes were.

Also, there is a rubric entry for "professionalism" -
I'm hoping my "theme" doesn't disqualify from that. I'm
just having a little fun with it as it progresses.  If 
I need to button up and put on a tie, I can do that
easy enough - but would rather enjoy working in 
Cretaceous Park...

The "Select User Role" drop down is also a experiment
in progress.  The way I envision it would be to 
limit tab access based on role, although that is not
explicitly required, it seemed like a good idea to me.

Thanks
